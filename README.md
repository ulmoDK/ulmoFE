# Introduction

My small finite element pet-project. Created for my-self to make a object-oriented finite element code that is easy for me to extend. Still in a start up phase.

# Contribute

There isn't really much to contribute to at the moment. But who knows, maybe in the future if the code grows to a reasonable size
